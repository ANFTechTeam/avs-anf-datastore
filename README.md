## Azure NetApp Files datastore for Azure VMware Solution (AVS) Hands-on Lab Guide

[Azure NetApp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/netapp/) is an enterprise-class, high-performance, metered file storage service. The service supports the most demanding enterprise file workloads in the cloud: databases, SAP, and high-performance computing applications, with no code changes. For more information on Azure NetApp files, see the [Azure NetApp Files documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-netapp-files/).

[Azure VMware Solution](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-vmware/) provides you with private clouds that contain VMware vSphere clusters built from dedicated bare-metal Azure infrastructure. Azure VMware Solution supports attaching Network File System (NFS) datastores as a persistent storage option. You can create NFS datastores with Azure NetApp Files volumes and attach them to clusters of your choice. For more information on Azure VMware Solution, see the [Azure VMware Solution documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-vmware/).

By using NFS datastores backed by Azure NetApp Files, you can expand your storage instead of scaling the clusters. 

Note: You can also [Attach Azure NetApp Files to Azure VMware Solution VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-vmware/netapp-files-with-azure-vmware-solution) directly via NFS or SMB.

In this VMware hands-on lab, you'll begin with a provisioned Azure VMware Solution (AVS) private cloud and cluster to complete the following exercises:
1. [Create an Azure NetApp Files (ANF) volume](./index.md#create-an-azure-netapp-files-anf-volume)
2. [Attach your new ANF volume to your AVS private cloud as a datastore](./index.md#attach-your-new-anf-volume-to-your-avs-private-cloud-as-a-datastore)
3. [Migrate a running virtual machine to your new ANF datastore](./index.md#migrate-a-running-virtual-machine-to-your-new-anf-datastore)
4. [Protect your virtual machine using NetApp's Cloud Backup Service for Virtual Machines (CBS for VMs)](./index.md#protect-your-virtual-machine-using-netapps-cloud-backup-service-for-virtual-machines-cbs-for-vms))
5. [Restore your virtual machine using NetApp's CBS for VMs](./index.md#restore-your-virtual-machine-using-netapps-cbs-for-vms)
